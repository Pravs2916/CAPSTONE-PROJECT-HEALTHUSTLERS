This week 6, we focused on data preprocessing and loading into the HEX system. We revisited our datasets, including the HEDIS Public Use Files 2024, 2023 Star Ratings Data Tables, and 2024 Star Ratings Data Tables sourced from the CMS website. 
Our tasks involved checking for missing values, ensuring data consistency, and preparing the data for further analysis. 
Additionally, we reviewed CMS evaluation criteria for Medicare Advantage plans to refine our analysis approach. Moving forward, we will conduct exploratory data analysis and develop interactive visualizations to identify trends in plan performance.
