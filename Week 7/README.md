This week, we merged the 2023 and 2024 CMS Star Ratings and HEDIS data, focusing on breast and colorectal cancer screenings. 
The data was cleaned, validated through hex, and successfully merged for analysis.
Preliminary findings indicate changes in the cut points for screenings, which impact the CMS Star Ratings.
Next steps include further analysis and visualization of the trends. 
This analysis will help identify the impact of these changes on plan performance and provide insights for improving quality measures.
The final goal is to provide actionable recommendations for enhancing Medicare Advantage plans.
