This project aims to analyze the quality of care in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans using HEDIS measures and CMS Star Ratings.
We have gathered relevant datasets on HEDIS performance, CMS Star Ratings, and enrollment trends, focusing on checking the consistency and relevance of the data. 
This week, we reviewed the data for missing values and standardized the formats for analysis.
Moving forward, we plan to use Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA), including analyzing trends and examining the impact of Star Ratings, while developing interactive dashboards with tools like Plotly or Streamlit.
The goal is to provide data-driven insights to improve MA plan quality and patient outcomes.
