This week, the project focus was shifted to analyzing six core HEDIS measures from 2017 to 2024.
Data was cleaned, merged, and organized to support trend analysis across Medicare Advantage plans.
Initial visualizations for several measures were created in Tableau.
Work continues on completing the visuals and building the final interactive dashboard.
